Analysis

1. There are 576 unique players of which 84% are Male.  However, the average female user has spend on 9.8% ($4.47 vs $4.07)more than the males users.  
It may be worth targeting some more outreach to females as the data shows they spend more.

2.  The age bracket shows the vast majority of players fall in the 15-29 age range with 20-24 having the most. 
Initially I would have guessed that the player age went up so would the revenue per player, however this is not the case. 
The age bracket with the highest revenue per user is 35-39 followed by <10, the other brackets.
If we had more data such as time spent playing video games per week and disposable income we might be able to get more insights


3. The top 5 players (0.87%) represent $74.96 or 3.1% of revenue.  Although the data skews toward the top player purchasers there is a still good distribution.

4. The purchase price for the top 2 items ($4.61 and $4.23) is well above the the $3.05 average purchase price.  
This shows that despite the higher cost there is still significant demand and that these items should be looked more indepth on why they are so popular
